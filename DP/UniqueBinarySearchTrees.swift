/**
 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/
 * Primary idea: DP(i) represent the number of unique BST, and the root value can be any number in (1...n).
 *
 * State Transition Equation: DP(i) = sum{DP(j, i-j-1), j in [0..<i]}
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(n)
