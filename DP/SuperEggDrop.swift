/**
 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/
 * Primary idea: DP(K, N) means the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is.
 *
 * State Transition Equation: DP(K, N) = min(1 + max(DP(K - 1, N - 1), DP{K, N - x))), x in [1...N]
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(K * N * N), Space Complexity: O(K * N)
